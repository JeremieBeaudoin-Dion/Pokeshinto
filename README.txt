Pokeshinto is a Pokemon-Type RPG game made with pure Java.

It has 4 main packages.

Pokeshinto
As the principal package with the name of the game, Pokeshinto holds the principal MVC classes of the game. The main method is in the class Game.java

Combat
Combat has all the classes which are used during a combat state of the game. It handles combat logic, it instanciates the combat, etc.

Images
This one is pretty straight forward. The classes in images will create the frame of the game, and handle any PhysicalObject.java to be put on screen.

World
World holds the maps and main logic of the adventure-side of the game.
